INTRODUCTION:
This project explores a Machine Learning-driven approach to evaluate trust in the Social Internet of Things (SIoT), focusing on a time-aware model. With the increase in interconnected IoT devices, establishing reliable and trustworthy connections is critical. Our model leverages time-sensitive features to assess and adapt to changing trust levels dynamically.

OBJECTIVES:
Develop a machine learning model to evaluate trustworthiness in SIoT networks.
Incorporate time-awareness into trust evaluation to handle real-time, dynamic trust assessments.
Enhance security and reliability in SIoT by identifying untrustworthy entities based on various contextual factors.

FEATURES:
Time-Aware Trust Assessment: Utilizes time-series data to adapt trust evaluations dynamically.
Machine Learning Integration: Employs ML techniques to improve prediction accuracy in trust assessment.
Contextual Analysis: Considers contextual information from social and interactional aspects for a holistic trust evaluation.
